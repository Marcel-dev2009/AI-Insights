        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines, 
        enabling them to perform tasks that typically require human cognitive functions. <br>     
          It includes technologies like machine learning and natural language processing. AI can analyze data, recognize patterns, 
          and make decisions, finding applications in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and entertainment. 
          While it offers significant benefits, such as increased efficiency and innovation, 
          it also raises concerns about job displacement and ethical issues.

          <h4>High Altitude Platform stations (HAPS)</h4>
          <p>
            High Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) are airborne systems operating at altitudes of 20 to 50 <br>
             kilometers that provide services like telecommunications and broadband internet. <br>
             They offer broad coverage, low latency, and cost-effective solutions for remote areas. <br>
             HAPS are typically powered by solar energy and can be deployed using balloons, drones, or airships. <br>
          </p>
          <h4>Key Features</h4>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Altitude </b>: Operate at 20 to 50 kilometers above sea level, <br>
                providing a wide coverage area. <br>
                 with features such as a head, arms, and legs.</li> <br>
              <li><b>Positioning </b>: HAPS are often placed in geostationary or geosynchronous positions, <br>
                allowing them to provide continuous coverage over specific areas.</li> <br>
              <li> <b>Mobility and Flexibility</b> : HAPS can be relocated or adjusted in altitude and position more easily than satellites, <br>
                offering flexibility in coverage and service provision.</li> <br>
              <li> <b>Low Latency</b> : Due to their proximity to the Earth, <br>
                HAPS can provide lower latency communication compared to satellites in higher orbits.

          <h4>Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)</h4>
          <p>
            Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is an emerging paradigm that combines data sensing and <br> 
            communication technologies into a single, unified system. <br>
            This approach seeks to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of both tasks by <br>
            leveraging overlapping functionalities and shared resources. <br>
          </p>
          <h4>Key Features</h4>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Dual Functionality :</b> ISAC systems can simultaneously gather environmental data <br>
                (like radar or imaging) and communicate information, optimizing the use of spectrum and energy</li> <br>
              <li><b>Enhanced Performance :</b> By integrating sensing and communication systems, <br>
                ISAC can improve accuracy and reliability, facilitate real-time decision-making, and reduce latency.</li> <br>
              <li><b>Application Potential : </b>ISAC is particularly beneficial in applications such as autonomous vehicles, <br>
                 smart cities, and the Internet of Things (IoT), where real-time data collection and communication are crucial.</li> <br>
              <li> <b>Faster Communication :</b> faster communication is a key feature of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC). <br>
                 By combining sensing and communication functions, ISAC reduces latency and optimizes data transfer, <br>
                 enabling quicker responses and real-time interactions, which is crucial in applications like autonomous driving. <br>
