      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines, 
        enabling them to perform tasks that typically require human cognitive functions. <br>     
          It includes technologies like machine learning and natural language processing. AI can analyze data, recognize patterns, 
          and make decisions, finding applications in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and entertainment. 
          While it offers significant benefits, such as increased efficiency and innovation, 
          it also raises concerns about job displacement and ethical issues.

          <h4>Humanoid Robots</h4>
          <p>
            Humanoid AI refers to artificial intelligence systems designed to replicate human-like behavior and appearance. <br>
             These AI technologies often take the form of robots or virtual avatars and <br> 
             are programmed to interact with humans in natural ways, <br>
             using voice, facial expressions, and body language.

          <h4>Key Features</h4>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Humanlike Appearance : Many humanoid AI's are built <br>
                to resemble humans physically, <br>
                 with features such as a head, arms, and legs.</li> <br>
              <li>Natural Interaction : They can engage in conversation, <br>
                interpret emotional cues, and respond appropriately, <br>
                making interactions feel more intuitive.</li> <br>
              <li>Learning and Adaptation: Using machine learning, <br>
                humanoid AIs can improve over time based on user <br>
                interactions and feedback.</li> <br>
              <li> Applications: They are used in various fields, including customer service, <br>
                healthcare, entertainment, and education, <br>
                often serving roles like companions, assistants, or trainers. </li>

          <h4>High Altitude PLatform stations (HAPS)</h4>
          <p>
            High Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) are airborne systems operating at altitudes of 20 to 50 <br>
             kilometers that provide services like telecommunications and broadband internet. <br>
             They offer broad coverage, low latency, and cost-effective solutions for remote areas. <br>
             HAPS are typically powered by solar energy and can be deployed using balloons, drones, or airships. <br>
          </p>
          <h4>Key Features</h4>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Altitude: Operate at 20 to 50 kilometers above sea level, <br>
                providing a wide coverage area. <br>
                 with features such as a head, arms, and legs.</li> <br>
              <li>Natural Interaction : They can engage in conversation, <br>
                interpret emotional cues, and respond appropriately, <br>
                making interactions feel more intuitive.</li> <br>
