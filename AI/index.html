          <h4>High Altitude Platform stations (HAPS)</h4>
          <p>
            High Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) are airborne systems operating at altitudes of 20 to 50 <br>
             kilometers that provide services like telecommunications and broadband internet. <br>
             They offer broad coverage, low latency, and cost-effective solutions for remote areas. <br>
             HAPS are typically powered by solar energy and can be deployed using balloons, drones, or airships. <br>
          </p>
          <h4>Key Features</h4>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Altitude </b>: Operate at 20 to 50 kilometers above sea level, <br>
                providing a wide coverage area. <br>
                 with features such as a head, arms, and legs.</li> <br>
              <li><b>Positioning </b>: HAPS are often placed in geostationary or geosynchronous positions, <br>
                allowing them to provide continuous coverage over specific areas.</li> <br>
              <li> <b>Mobility and Flexibility</b> : HAPS can be relocated or adjusted in altitude and position more easily than satellites, <br>
                offering flexibility in coverage and service provision.</li> <br>
              <li> <b>Low Latency</b> : Due to their proximity to the Earth, <br>
                HAPS can provide lower latency communication compared to satellites in higher orbits.
